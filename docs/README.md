# PandapeChallenge


The objective of this training is to create an application by putting into practice concepts such as:
DDD, SOLID, Code first, dependency injection, error handling, unit testing with xUnit and the MVC, CQRS and Mediator patterns.

### Requirements: 

A recruiter needs to manage a database of candidates for a selection process. 
From the tables Candidate and Candidate Experience develop an application where you can:

- Consult a list of registered candidates. 
- Register new candidates and their professional experience. 
- Edit a candidate's registration and professional experience. 
- Delete a candidate.

### Please note: 

The current implementation only includes the development in CandidatesController, 
understanding this as a model to be followed in CandidateExperiencesController.

### Pending development: 

Many artefacts are still to be developed, however, it is worth mentioning some artefacts that I consider necessary in the next development steps. 

Replicate CQRS implementation on CandidateExperiencesController
Pagination Sorting and Filtering
Implement Validation Rules 
Globar error handling 
Create custom errors for Error Handling
Saving logs in database 
Sensitive information management with encryption
